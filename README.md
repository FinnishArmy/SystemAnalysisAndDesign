# SystemAnalysisAndDesign
For Southern New Hampshire University CS255 Class.

## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass Project was to go through the entire business design from scratch, a simple interview. We had to design from the ground up, the design document, presentation, develop functional and non-functional requirements, constraints and limitations. 

## What did you do particularly well?
I believe what I did particularly well was to articulate the requirements, and limitaitons. It can be difficult to find all the possible limitations of a system, and many can be easily overlooked. I think I found as many as possible for this specific system.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think I would choose to revise the use-case diagram, mainly because I am not fully developed in the skillset of creating these diagrams. I would review my own and professional diagrams to find what I need to improve on. I did revise it from the original one already, but I still think it isn't perfect.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I reviewed the transcript with great detail to see what specific things were talked about and when a specific thing was requested. Some requirements are easy like "We need the system to do this." While some others are more nuanced and hard to articulate. If you don't consider the user's needs when designing a system, it's difficult to even know what you're designing. 

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I extensively review the requirements for a system. Then beging to write drafts of the system (the diagrams), then I can begin writing pseudo code for it. Once the pseudo code feels good enough, I can beging writing the actual system.
